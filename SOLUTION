Kernel System Calls
-------------------
Strace command output shows all the system calls which has been made when we executed the file whatIdo.
It Checks if a file exists and is readable.
In the output we can see that the file executed and asked to replace the current program which is running on the CPU.
It asked to check where is the heap memory end in order to locate a place to the current program there.
It performs various operations such as opening files, writing to files, and closing them.
In the end, whatIdo exits with a status code of 0 which indicates on successful completion.


Broken Symlink
-------------------
The fix is to create a symlink (soft link) with an absolute path
The fix is to add the following line:
ABSOLUTE_PATH="$(pwd)/$FILENAME"



Binary Numbers
--------------
A.  111 --> (2^0)*1 + (2^1)*1 + (2^2)*1 = 7
    100 --> = 4
    10110 --> = 22

B.  Available decimal range represented by 8 bits binary numbers: 2^8 = 256

C.  Given a 9 bits binary number, suggest a method to represent negative numbers between -255 to 255.
    1. The last bit represent the bit sign:  `0` - will represent positive number, `1` - will represent negative number.
    2. There is a scale of numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    3. Check num fits to 128, if it does decrease 128 from num and continue to check the rest of the numbers on scale
        if its not - go to the next number on the scale, to 64 and check if it fits.

D.  Suggest a method to represent a floating point numbers, using 8 bits binary numbers:
    1. Check if the last bit represent the bit sign - if yes: `0` - will represent positive number, `1` - will represent negative number.
    2. Take the num and separate the num with its Fraction.
    3. The num check if it fits to 128, if it does decrease 128 from num and continue to check the rest of the numbers on scale
        if its not - go to the next number on the scale, to 64 and check if it fits.
    4. The fraction you take and multiplied by 2
